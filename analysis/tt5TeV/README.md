## Analysis

The main analysis is in `tt5TeV.py`. To run it, use the `run.py` scrip. You need to have json files with the samples. For example, send a job to process tt sample with 

    python analysis/tt5TeV/run.py cafea/json/5TeV/poolphedex/TTPS.json -n 64 -j -o TTPS

To execute all the samples, you can use the script `run5TeV.sh`.

## The config script

The config script, `analysis/tt5TeV/config.py` is imported by all the plotting scripts of the repo. It contains basic information about paths, rebinnings and other stuff. You might want to modify some of the paths, especially some of the output paths, which are by default created according to the current date. It also define some labels to use in the legends, etc.

## QCD estimate

To estimate QCD, you need to have run over all the samples and have a folder with all the .pkl.gz files. The script `SaveQCD.py` takes those inputs and creates a `QCD.pkl.gz` file with the QCD estimate. Run the script as:

    python analysis/tt5TeV/SaveQCD.py -p histos5TeV/16jan2023/ -n 32

You can draw QCD plots (that is, events with fake electrons and muons) using the `DrawQCD.py` script. For example:
    
    python analysis/tt5TeV/DrawQCD.py -p histos5TeV/16jan2023/

## Plotting and tables

There are several scripts to create plots and tables. You can find a description of some of them below.

 - ControlPlots.py: Produce control plots. You can modify the variables, channels and levels. This script produces data/MC plots in general. It is also used to produce MVA and QCD control plot.
Example:

    python analysis/tt5TeV/ControlPlots.py -p histos5TeV/16jan2023/ -n 16

 - PlotSystematics.py: Produce systematic plots, including comparisions. By default, it is done for ttbar only.
Example:

    python analysis/tt5TeV/PlotSystematics.py -p histos5TeV/16jan2023/ 

 - DrawTTmodAltSamp.py: Produce plots for hdamp and UE tune uncertainties from alternative samples where the systematic uncertainty of the alternative predictions is shown, as a function of jet and b-tag multiplicities.
Example:

    python analysis/tt5TeV/DrawTTmodAltSamp.py -p histos5TeV/22jan2023/

## MVA plots

MVA plots are produced with several scripts. Some of them are produced with the `ControlPlots.py` script, mentioned above. Training and performance plots are produced with `MVAplots.py` scripts as follows:

    python analysis/tt5TeV/MVAplots.py

In this case, the relevant paths are directly hardcoded in the script.

## Datacards

You need to create rootfiles and datacards to produce fits and extract the cross section.
Rootfiles are created with `analysis/tt5TeV/SaveRootfile.py` and then, datacards are created with `analysis/tt5TeV/CreateDatacard.py`.
A script to create all the needed rootfiles and datacards in the analysis is executed as follows:

    python analysis/tt5TeV/RunCombineProducer.py -p histos5TeV/16jan2023/

The uncertainties must be specified in the python `analysis/tt5TeV/CreateDatacard.py` script. The distributions are specified first in the  `analysis/tt5TeV/SaveRootfile.py` script.
